/*Given a singly linked list, the task is to delete the middle node of the list.
If the list contains an even number of nodes, there will be two middle nodes. In this case, delete the second middle node.
If the linked list consists of only one node, then return NULL.
Example:
Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 1->2->4->5
Input: LinkedList: 2->4->6->7->5->1
Output: 2->4->6->5->1
