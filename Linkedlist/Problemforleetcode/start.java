/*Given a singly linked list and a key, the task is to delete the last occurrence of that key in the linked list.

Examples: 
Input: head: 1 -> 2 -> 3 ->1  -> 4 -> NULL, key = 1 
Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL
*/

/*The idea in the question is that I have to delete the key occurance which is happen in the last of linked list and it is singly linked list so I have to travese the 
whole singly linked list and find and store the number where the last time key was found and than delete that key*/
