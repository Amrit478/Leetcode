/*Question 

Given two sorted arrays, the task is to merge them in a sorted manner.
Examples: 

Input: arr1[] = { 1, 3, 4, 5}, arr2[] = {2, 4, 6, 8} 
Output: arr3[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 8}*/

/*Naive approach to put both of these together and sort them using sorting method and the o(n) time be square 

However I will be solving it using optimization method where I will be solving it using merge sort and now I will try to solve it*/

//Main method where it will be solved

//I will compare both array and than decide which element should go first based on that







public class Mergearray {
  //Need to write when reach home 
psvm{
  
}
}
