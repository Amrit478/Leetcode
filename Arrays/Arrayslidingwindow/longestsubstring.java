/*Question:
Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.
Input: s = "eceba", k = 2  
Output: 3  
Explanation: The substring is "ece" with length 3.
Input: s = "aa", k = 1  
Output: 2  
Explanation: The entire string "aa" has only one distinct character.
🔹 Constraints:
1 ≤ k ≤ 26 here it is O(2^n) and it will be solved using recursion, backtracking or bit manipulation
s.length ≤ 10⁵
s consists of lowercase English letters*/
